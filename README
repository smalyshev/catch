Module to catch & report fatal errors and crashes in PHP.

Configs:
catch.oncrash=stop,trace,phptrace
catch.onerror=phptrace

Actions:
- stop - display message on stderr with PID and pause
- trace - print C backtrace to stderr (may be useless if you don't have debug info)
- phptrace - print PHP backtrace to stderr
- throw - on PHP error, convert it to exception. Don't use it, unless you know what you're doing. It will probably crash.
